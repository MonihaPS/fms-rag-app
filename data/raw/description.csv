BANDED SUMO SQUATS,Level 2 RNT drill. Bands around knees force the athlete to drive knees out (abduction), engaging the glute medius during the wide stance.,,,
KB HOLD SUMO SQUATS (HANG/ GOBLET),Level 3 loaded patterning. The wide base provides high stability, allowing the athlete to focus purely on the hip hinge mechanics.,,,
DB SUMO SQUATS (HANG/ GOBLET),Level 4 strength. Dumbbell variation allows for independent hand positioning, challenging grip and symmetry.,,,
BB SUMO SQUATS (HANG/ RACKED),"Level 5 strength. Barbell loading increases systemic demand. The ""Hang"" position keeps the weight center of mass low", aiding balance.,,,
PLATE HOLD SUMO SQUATS,Level 6 anterior core. Holding a plate out front acts as a counterbalance, forcing the core to brace against the long lever arm.,,,
ZERCHER HOLD SUMO SQUATS,Level 7 anti-flexion. The Zercher carry forces the athlete to fight against collapsing forward, building massive upper back strength.,,,
JEFFERSON HOLD SUMO SQUATS,Level 8 multi-planar. An asymmetrical barbell lift that challenges rotation and anti-rotation stability.,,,,
BW B/L BOX SQUATS,Level 1 depth control. The box provides a tactile target, ensuring consistent depth and safety. Removes the stretch reflex, forcing voluntary muscular contraction.,,
BW U/L BOX SQUATS,Level 2 asymmetry check. Single leg box squat. limits the range of motion to a safe height while building unilateral strength.,,,,
BW LOW BOX SQUATS,Level 3 mobility range. Using a lower box to progressively increase the depth demand as mobility improves.,,,,
KB GOBLET HOLD BOX SQUATS,Level 4 loaded control. Adding load to the box pattern. Teaches the athlete to absorb force quietly on the box rather than crashing down.,,,,
DB BOX SQUATS,Level 5 independent loading. Using dumbbells adds a stability component to the fixed range of motion of the box.,,,,

KB TOP UP GOBLET SQUATS,Level 2 grip/stability. Holding the KB upside down (bottoms up) demands intense grip and shoulder stability, radiating tension to the core.,,,
KB BOTTOM UP GOBLET SQUATS,Level 3 classic loading. The standard for building squat volume safely. Self-limiting: if the upper back rounds, the weight drops.,,,
KB SIDE GOBLET SQUATS,Level 4 lateral bias. Holding the weight to one side (offset) forces the obliques to fight rotation.,,,,
KB B/L RACKED SQUATS,Level 2 front load. Double kettlebells in the rack position compress the chest, forcing high respiratory demand and thoracic extension.,,,
KB U/L RACKED SQUATS,Level 3 offset load. One KB racked. The unequal load tries to pull the athlete sideways; the core must fight to stay vertical.,,,,
KB SUITCASE SQUATS,Level 4 anti-lateral flexion. Holding weights at sides (like suitcases). If the core is weak, the weights hit the floor.,,,
KB CYCLIC SQUATS,Level 8 conditioning. Continuous tension reps with Kettlebells. High metabolic demand for conditioning phases.,,,,
DB RACKED SQUATS,Level 3 independent stability. Dumbbells in the rack position require more shoulder stability than a barbell but less wrist flexibility.,,,,
